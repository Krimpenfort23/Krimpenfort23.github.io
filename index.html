                        Hi! My name is Evan Krimpenfort and this is all that is about me.
                        All of the work done on this website was done by me and only me because
                        I wanted this to be a learning experience in web development... And
                        GitHub allowed me to use their pages for free, but that's besides the point!
                        I'm an avid learner and this is where I want to show it and keep an update
                        on all of my work.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="home" style="width: auto;">
                    <p>

                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
